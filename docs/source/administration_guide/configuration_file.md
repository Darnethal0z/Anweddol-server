# Configuration file

----

The Anweddol server implementation is using a YAML file for configuration.

It is stored in `/etc/anweddol/config.yaml` after installation, read its header to learn about it.

```{tip}
If you need to get the default configuration file back, you can retrieve it in the `resource` folder at the root of the downloaded package.
